# Lead Tracker

Lead Tracker is a web extension that allows users to save URLs in local storage and access them at any time. With this extension, users can easily manage and track their leads by saving important web pages and revisiting them whenever needed. The extension provides the following key features:

1. **Save Input**: Users can save any random URL by entering it manually into the extension's input field and clicking the "Save" button. This feature enables users to store specific web pages related to their leads for quick access.

2. **Save Tab**: With the "Save Tab" functionality, users can save the URL of the currently active tab in their browser. This feature is convenient when users come across a valuable lead while browsing and want to save it without manually entering the URL.

3. **Delete all**: By double-clicking on the extension's list of saved URLs, users can instantly clear the entire list. This functionality provides an easy way to remove all the saved leads when needed.
